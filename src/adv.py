### Notes about my code to make the game run ###
# My game starts with a welcome message, and explanation of the scenario, and asks what their player name is. 
# Then, It will run the functions I've written. 
# After the game, it will ask if you want to play again. If yes, run the functions again. If no, it will exit the game.

### Defining my functions ###

##TO DO:
#done # game is stuck in a loop. need to fix the loop first
#done #need to need to add the location identifier of which room they are in
# need to add ability to move into a different room.
